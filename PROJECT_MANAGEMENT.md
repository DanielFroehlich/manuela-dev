# Agile Projectmanagement for MANUela

## MANUela - Strategic board

A meeting to discuss new user stories / use cases and the next steps of MANUela. It is also used to improve and refine the Product backlog.

Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items. During Product Backlog refinement, items are reviewed and revised.

* On a monthly base
* Should be conducted before a Sprint planning meeting.

## Scrum Guide

> The core MANUela team decided to work on MANUela with an agile methodology, aligned to Scrum.

Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage work on complex products since the early 1990s. Scrum is not a process, technique, or definitive method. Rather, it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Scrum makes clear the relative efficacy of your product management and work techniques so that you can continuously improve the product, the team, and the working environment.

Please refer to the official [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) to get more information on Scrum.

## MANUela - Scrum Adaption

Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum Events section of the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html):

* Sprint Planning
* Daily Scrum
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospective

### MANUela - Sprint Definition / Rules

> Here are the adjustments for MANUela:

* The Sprint duration is one month.
* The Sprint duration is not negotiable.
* We choose a team member as PO per Sprint.
* We always define a Sprint Goal.

During the Sprint:

* No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
* Quality goals do not decrease; and,
* Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

### MANUela - Sprint Planning

### MANUela - Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team. 
> The MANUela Daily Scrum is not held daily, instead it is held every monday and thursday at 8:45 AM in the week of a Sprint and participation is not mandatory.

### MANUela - Sprint Review

A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint.

* This is at most a four-hour meeting for one-month Sprints.

The Sprint Review includes the following elements:

* Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner;
* The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been "Done" and what has not been "Done";
* The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved;
* The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers questions about the Increment;
* The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely target and delivery dates based on progress to date (if needed);
* The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning;
* Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next; and,
* Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated releases of functionality or capability of the product.

### MANUela - Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

* The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning.
* This is at most a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints.

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:

* Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
* Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,
* Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.

### MANUela - Backlog

The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product.
It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.
The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.

### MANUela - Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality into a "Done" Increment.
